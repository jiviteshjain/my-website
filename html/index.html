                            My biggest passion is learning, including learning to learn. Obsessed with technology as much as I am, I love learning to code - just because it empowers you to solve so many challenges and real-world problems effectively. (Also why I decided to pursue my bachelor's in computer science.) Apart from that, I like studying physics - from the physics behind the gorgeous northern lights to the physics that runs our everyday lives.
                            <br>
                            Next on my list of passions is Art. With a craving for sketching and painting, my notebooks are often <i>adorned</i> with doodles and my sketchbook with pencil-shadings, sketches and paintings.<i> Although rarely, I also tend to target walls.</i>
                            <br>
                            Playing badminton and learning about the world's languages and their impact on our civilisation are some other things that interest and de-stress <i>(this sounds eerily and ironically similar to 'distress')</i> me.

            <p class="textsubhead">...that changed me as a person.</p>
            <p class="textbody">
                It was my fifth year studying German when I appeared on the <i>Fit in Deutsch 2 (A2)</i> examination conducted by the Goethe Institute. My happiness knew no bounds and I was still partly dazed by the clouds of disbelief as I heard my name being called off the list of candidates selected for an all-expenses-paid trip to Germany.<br>
                Once there, we were enrolled in <i>Jugendkurs Aachen 2016</i> - a German Language Course - along with other people from all around the world. It was three weeks of intensive learning, great fun, amazing experiences and memories to cherish.<br>
                It was on the last day that, standing by the waters of the Rhine, I could instrospect upon the impact of the course on me - it was not merely a prize, and had not just taught me the German Language - but it had made me independent and given me the exposure and confidence necessary to face the world. It had played its small part in transforming this child into a youth - justifying itself as a <i>Jugendkurs</i>.
